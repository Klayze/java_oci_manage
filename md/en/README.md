## Overview

R-Bot is a **dual-architecture** multi-cloud infrastructure management system that drives a local client through a Telegram bot for quick management of Oracle Cloud (OCI), AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, SolusVM, VirtFusion, and more. The client also includes a built-in **Web SSH Terminal** and **Web Cloud Management Panel**, providing in-browser server operations and cloud resource management.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dual-Architecture Security** | API private keys are stored only on your local client; the bot stores no sensitive data |
| **Telegram Bot Management** | 30+ cloud operations: boot instances, manage IPs, disks, monitoring, etc. |
| **Smart Web SSH Terminal** | Host dashboard + terminal workspace with multi-tab, SFTP, port forwarding, and smart multi-key auto-matching |
| **Web Cloud Management** | Manage instances, networks, volumes, users, DNS, object storage, serial console from your browser |
| **Multi-Cloud Support** | Oracle Cloud, AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, SolusVM, VirtFusion |
| **Cloudflare Integration** | DNS management, automatic SSL certificates, DNS updated when the IP changes |
| **MCP Access** | Let Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor work on the servers you authorize through the panel, without handing over passwords or keys |
| **Cloud Monitoring & Expiry Alerts** | Auto-shutdown on traffic overage, auto-restart on unexpected stop, Telegram alerts before domains and certificates expire |
| **Cloud Host Sync** | One-click discover and sync hosts from multiple clouds to SSH session list |
| **Lightweight** | Starts in a second, low memory use, runs on routers too |

## Quick Start

### 1. Follow the Channel and Bot

- [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/agentONE_R) — Update notifications
- [Telegram Bot](https://t.me/radiance_helper_bot) — Get credentials and control panel

### 2. One-Click Install

```bash
wget -O sh_client_bot.sh https://github.com/semicons/java_oci_manage/releases/latest/download/sh_client_bot.sh && chmod +x sh_client_bot.sh && bash sh_client_bot.sh
```

> Recommended: create a directory first — `mkdir rbot && cd rbot`

### 3. Start

```bash
bash sh_client_bot.sh
```

After startup, visit `https://YOUR_IP:9527`.

### 4. Activate the Client

On first startup, credentials are auto-generated and an activation banner appears at the top of the page. Two ways to activate:

- **Option 1**: Copy the `/bindclient` command shown on the page and send it to the [Telegram Bot](https://t.me/radiance_helper_bot)
- **Option 2**: If you already have an account, click "Already have an account?" and enter your existing credentials

Once activated, add your cloud API parameters to start using the platform.

## How It Works

```
You → Telegram bot → your own client → your clouds
You → Browser ─────→ your own client → your clouds
```

- The client runs on your own server, and your cloud API keys are stored only there
- The bot just passes your commands to the client and keeps no keys
- Stop the client whenever you want out
