# Cloud Management Panel Guide

[简体中文](../cloud.md)

Manage Oracle Cloud, AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, SolusVM, VirtFusion, and Cloudflare DNS in the browser. It covers much the same ground as the Telegram bot.

---

## Getting there

Go to `https://your-ip:9527`, sign in, and switch to "Cloud".

The first time, upload your cloud API configs: Settings → Config File Settings in the top bar, or edit `client_config` directly — see [Installation & Configuration](./install.md).

---

## Overview

The current account at a glance:

| Card | Content |
|------|------|
| **Cost** | Spending over the last 3 months |
| **Traffic** | Traffic over the last 3 months |
| **Subscription** | Type, payment method, validity |
| **Quota** | How much instance, network, and storage quota is used |

Switch profiles to look at other accounts.

## Oracle Cloud

### Instances

| Action | Notes |
|------|------|
| Instance list | Every instance and its state, with boot volume info |
| Create instance | Pick shape, OS, network and launch — see [Oracle Instance Launch Guide](./boot-oracle.md) |
| Quick config | Fill in the whole form for AMD Micro 1C/1G or ARM A1 2C/12G in one click |
| Create from boot volume | Launch from an existing boot volume, system and data intact; one instance at a time, and only in that volume's availability domain |
| Force ARM | Improves ARM launch success on trial accounts (briefly uses a paid feature — at your own risk) |
| Quick boot | Fill the form from a launch config saved on the bot |
| See the result | After submitting, the outcome is shown on the page and sent over Telegram |
| Start / stop / reboot | Basic actions |
| Terminate | Delete the instance, optionally keeping its boot volume |
| Reinstall | Back to the original OS image |
| Resize | Change CPU and memory |

### Network / IP

| Action | Notes |
|------|------|
| NIC list | NICs, private IPs, public IPs |
| Change IPv4 | Get a new public IPv4 |
| Change IPv6 | Get a new IPv6 |
| Delete IP | Remove a public IP or IPv6 |
| Attach IPv4 | Add another IPv4 to the instance |
| Attach IPv6 | Create a new IPv6 |
| Attach reserved IP | Attach a reserved public IP |

### Volumes

| Action | Notes |
|------|------|
| Volume list | Every disk, and whether it is attached to an instance |
| Resize | Grow only, never shrink |
| Adjust VPU | Faster disk IO |
| Batch VPU | Max out VPU on every disk at once |
| Detach | Take a disk off its instance. Stop the instance first |
| Attach boot volume | Put a detached boot volume back on an instance. Stop the instance first |
| Delete | Permanent |

Detached boot volumes live in the "Unattached Boot Volumes" panel. If an instance has no boot volume, clicking "Boot Volume" takes you straight there.

### A1 audit / downscale

Oracle's ARM free allowance is per account, and accounts over it risk having resources reclaimed. This checks accounts in bulk and brings them back within the allowance.

| Action | Notes |
|------|------|
| Audit | Check ARM usage per account against the free allowance (2 OCPU / 12 GB) and flag over-allowance, compliant, or query failed |
| Downscale account | Set a target (2 OCPU / 12 GB by default) and split it evenly across that account's instances |
| Batch downscale | Select every downscalable account and submit at once |
| Per instance | Downscale a single instance |
| Delete instance | One at a time with confirmation; no bulk delete |

Out-of-capacity errors during a downscale are retried until it succeeds; the result arrives over Telegram and the task can be cancelled from the task list. It only ever downscales and **never deletes an instance on its own**. Running instances reboot during the change.

Free users can audit the current account only; Lightning users can handle every account at once.

### Users

| Action | Notes |
|------|------|
| User list | Every user in the tenancy |
| Create user | Add an administrator |
| Change email | Update a user's email |
| Reset password | Optionally let the system generate a strong one |
| Clear MFA | Remove every two-factor device on a user |
| Rename tenancy | Change the tenancy display name |
| Delete user | Remove a user |
| Password policy | See expiry and complexity rules |

### Object Storage

|------|------|
| Browse buckets | List every bucket |
| Browse files | Filter by prefix, paginate |

|------|------|
| Profile list | Every Oracle account, marking those with an API outbound proxy |
| Switch profile | Work on another account |
| Copy to new region | Duplicate an account with a different region instead of re-entering the API details |
| API outbound proxy | Give one account its own proxy — see [How-To Guide](./howto.md#give-each-account-its-own-outbound-ip) |
| Delete profile | Remove an account's config |

### Email Delivery

| Action | Notes |
|------|------|
| One-click setup | Enter a domain and sender address; the email domain, DKIM, DNS records, sender, and SMTP account are all set up for you |
| DNS setup | Automatic for domains on Cloudflare; otherwise the records are listed for you to add by hand before continuing |

---

## AWS

### EC2 instances

| Action | Notes |
|------|------|
| Instance list | Every EC2 instance and its state |
| Create instance | Pick image, type, SSH key; progress is shown after creating |

## Cloud monitoring

The "Cloud Monitoring" tab. It shares settings with the bot's instance monitoring — change either and both follow.

### Traffic guard

Oracle's free traffic is 10240 GB a month; beyond that you pay by usage. Set a limit per account and decide what happens when it is reached.

| Item | Notes |
|------|------|
| Account | Set per account |
| Threshold | In GB. Oracle's traffic figures lag by hours, so use 9000 rather than cutting it close at 10240 |
| Notify only | A Telegram message; instances untouched |
| Auto shutdown | Immediately stops that account's instances in **every region**, with no second confirmation |

Before choosing auto shutdown: if you start them again while still over, they are stopped again within the hour; and if they stay off too long, Oracle may take back hard-to-get A1 capacity, so you would be competing for it again.

### Uptime guard

| Toggle | Notes |
|------|------|
| Stop notifications | Telegram message when an instance stops unexpectedly |
| Auto-start | Start stopped instances again. Accounts shut down by traffic guard stay off for the rest of the month |

---

## Domain monitoring

The "Domain Monitoring" tab. Checks domain registration expiry and SSL certificate expiry every day and warns you over Telegram before they run out.

| Action | Notes |
|------|------|
| Add domain | Add one by hand |
| Import from Cloudflare | Pull in every domain on Cloudflare; ones already present are skipped |
| Reminder toggle | Per domain |
| Check now | Run a check immediately instead of waiting for the daily one |
| Search | Works with internationalized domains |
| Delete | Stop monitoring |

You get one reminder each at 30, 14, 7, and 1 day before expiry, and one on the day it expires.

Enter the main domain (`example.com`), not a subdomain. Subdomains have no registration date, so domain expiry shows "unknown" (certificate expiry still works).

Adding, importing, and turning on reminders need Lightning; disabling, deleting, viewing, and "Check now" do not.

---

## Settings

### Instance monitoring

| Feature | Notes |
|------|------|
| Instance alerts | Telegram message when an instance misbehaves |
| Auto-start | Try to start it again |
| Daily report | Spending and traffic every day |
| Health check | Check every account in one go |
| Account type in launch alerts | Launch notifications say whether the account is upgraded or regular; left out when unsure |

### Client upgrade and logs

In the settings menu. Same as the bot's "32. Upgrade Client" and "34. Latest Logs", and no Lightning needed.

**Upgrade**

| Action | Notes |
|------|------|
| Version check | Current and latest version |
| Upgrade now | Download the new version and restart |
| Force upgrade | Reinstall regardless of version — use it when the version check fails |
| Restart service | Restart without upgrading |

One upgrade or restart per 5 minutes. Terminals disconnect during an upgrade and are usually back within 1-3 minutes.

**Logs**

Read the client log in the browser: 100 / 300 / 1000 lines, keyword filter, auto-refresh, copy all. Handy for pasting a chunk to support when something goes wrong.

### SSL certificate

See [Web SSH Terminal Guide — SSL Certificates](./webssh.md#ssl-certificate-configuration).

### Cloud configs

Upload and edit your cloud API configs in the browser instead of logging into the server to edit `client_config`.

| Feature | Notes |
|------|------|
| Oracle | Paste the API config and upload the .pem key; the path is filled in for you |
| AWS | Paste the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key |
| GCP | Upload the service account JSON key |
| DigitalOcean | Paste the API token |
| Azure | Paste appId / password / tenant |
| SolusVM | Paste the API URL and keys |
| VirtFusion | Paste host / token; common vendors can be prefilled |
| Skip duplicates | Accounts with a name that already exists are skipped, with a notice |
| Edit online | Open an existing account and edit it in place |
| Copy to new region | Duplicate an Oracle or AWS account with a different region |
| API outbound proxy | At the bottom of the account editor. To turn it off, click "Remove Proxy" — clearing the fields and saving does not |
| Delete account | Remove one account's config |
| Hidden secrets | Keys and tokens are shown masked |
| AWS region check | Warns and offers a fix when a zone (e.g. `ap-southeast-1a`) is entered as a region |
| Cloudflare | API token (recommended) or email + Global API Key |
| Network | Local address, URL name, startup mode |
| Takes effect on save | No client restart needed |

---

## Themes

Eight themes, each in light and dark:

| Theme | Style |
|------|------|
| Classic | Default blue |
| Sakura | Pink |
| Cyber | Neon cyan |
| Ink | Gold, Chinese ink |
| Aurora | Teal-green-purple gradient |
| Stellar | Deep purple night sky |
| Abyss | Deep-sea blue-green |
| Sunset | Warm orange |

Switch theme and light / dark in the top bar.

---

## One-click SSH

Every instance card on every cloud has an "SSH" button that connects without typing the IP. The IP can be copied with one click as well.

---

## Multi-cloud overview

One page with instance totals, running and stopped counts, DNS details, and more across every cloud.

---

## Support chat

The floating button in the bottom-right opens a chat with support; you can send images. The button hides itself and can be dragged out of the way.
